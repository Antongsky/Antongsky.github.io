## 2022.3.19 Harvest from the vegetable bed! First attempt.

  Today, I harvested lettuce that was planted by our plant-growing group.
  We spread seeds last winter, and it took a week to come up. It grew so slow in the whole winter, that I can barely believe they could grow up successfully.
  There were a few spots of rain in the winter holiday, so the lettuce actually grew bigger in that month. After the winter holiday, especially in March, when the temperature reached 20 degrees, these plants began growing crazily. I was surprised to see how big they were after a few days not seeing them.
  At that period, I was always saying " Maybe tonight I will fertilize them.", but I always forgot. These plants could grow bigger if I remembered to fertilize them.

  Today is actually the first day I remember to fertilize them, using my liquid fertilizer. 
  Before that, I dug out 2 lettuces from the vegetable bed. For other plants, we can just leave them there and make them grow bigger. After I went back to the dorm, I washed it and cut it into pieces, added some salad sauce, and it became a nice cup of vegetable salad.

  It's the fruit of our industry! (Although actually, we didn't care about them too much, just water them a few times a week.) However, there is still something that I think we didn't do well and needed to be improved.
  Firstly, we didn't deal with our vegetable bed attentively. If we care for it more, the vegetables can grow better. Secondly, it's important to keep track of the growth of these vegetables, but we've been lazy so totally quit it. Finally, I think planting something which can be eaten row brings us true fun. Because if it's for cabbages or spinaches, we will not eat them, genuinely (we don't have a pot to cook them!). Next time we can plant some tomatoes and strawberries. These things can truly bring us happiness and achievement.
  After all, good job! This is the first time I harvest eatable vegetables in our vegetable bed. We obtain fresh vegetables by our own hands!
