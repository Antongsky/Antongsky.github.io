## Appreciating cherry blossoms in Haining city,2022.3.16!


  As the spring approaching, the temperature went higher and higher. Sakuras went to blossom all together.
  It is sooooo exciting to see these white cherry blossoms shinig in the spring sunshine. And the weather is mild and comfortable too! 
  On this afternoon that I don't have class, I can't help riding on the bicycle (actually brought from Che, Yuxing) and hanging out to see all these cute flowers.
  Firstly I noticed cherry blossoms on the lawn near the sidewalk. They were planted there just a few years ago, and are actually very small, not like those in the anime which are tall and big. 
  But I have to be appreciative because, on every tree, there hang so many flowers!

  These cherry blossoms are all Tokyo cherries (Prunus × yedoensis), which is a hybrid species. It looks fragile if you stand near enough to look at it. When standing far away from the bush, they look a bit red.
  The next station is "Dangxiao", a communist school. In front of the school, there are several BIG and TALL sakura trees planted there. I was so amazed because it's rare to see so tall a cherry blossom like this in China, and I had never seen such a big cherry tree before. 
  It's like that I was wandering in a dream! I was more devastated to find this kind of cherry is actually "Big island cherry (Prunus speciosa)". 
  Several days ago when they said there are Prunus speciosa in the Zijingang campus I was sad because during this quarantine period I couldn't go to Hangzhou. But, now this kind of cherry is here, lively in front of my eyes, and full of blossoms. I was shocked there.
  When I looked up, the dragging white flowers fulfilled all of my vision.
  After I left the school, I found another cherry "Prunus tomentosa" in a park. Initially, I didn't know whether it was peach or cherry because it looked like both to an extent. 
  I even wondered it could be a hybrid species of cherry and peach. After identifying by the AI application, I realized it was Prunus tomentosa. 
  My destination is Haichang road. I checked on the internet during the last winter vacation about where to appreciate cherry blossom in Haining, and the TOP1 place is Haichang Road. People say there are thousands of cherry blossoms planted on the sidewalk and is really beautiful in spring. So I always wanted to look at it when spring comes. Now it's a great chance!
  And I arrived there. 
  The cherries had dyed the road and the city scenery pink, as if in a dream. It's a white world, where flowers were blossoming drastically and crazily. From my site, the tallest building in Haining was visible from the spot, and everything weaved together to form a rosy and harmonious picture.
