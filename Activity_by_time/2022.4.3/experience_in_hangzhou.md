## A daunting but unforgettable experience in Hangzhou 2022.4.3
  I was threatened to death while looking at the crowd of the metro carriage. People were killing time on their mobile phones, or hugging their boy/girlfriends tightly, trying to balance themselves in the rushing metro.
  
  Everything seemed to become indifferent and cold, although the crowds caused the high temperature in the carriage. People were rushing here and there, trying to reach their destination-It's the tomb-sweeping holiday.
  
  I grabbed my mobile phone tightly, looking at these small red dots pumping out on Wechat chat board. People were talking about their lives, their plans for the holiday and how they would enjoy themselves. But for me, I wanted to cry but no one could offer help, so I ended up being helpless and in despair, still standing in the rushing metro.
  
  Actually, two days ago the Haining city terminated the traveling restriction because of the relief of the pandemic. All the public transport vehicles had come to normal so we could go to Hangzhou freely again. Also, the weather these days had been so good so it was a good time for traveling and having a spring tour. Exhilarated I went to Hangzhou.
  
  But the bad news came -Three were covid cases in  Haining again! When I woke up in the morning I was sorrowful because I was not sure whether there would be new traveling restrictions, but that doesn't matter, I thought. Because I'd booked the school bus from Yuquan Campus to the Haining campus, if taking the intercity railway became a real problem, I could take the school and went back to the Haining campus as well. Actually, in the afternoon, I did take the school bus. When the bus finally took off, I felt relaxed and safe, knowing I would be back in one or two hours. However, I was devastated that after docking at the Zijinggang Campus, the bus seemed to be driving on the wrong road. It didn't take much time before I noticed we were heading back to Yuquan!!
  
  My heart became cold to the core. But luckily there was just one station on the intercity railway that was closed, so it was possible that I took the metro, stopped at that station, took a taxi, and took the intercity railway train to the next station. But, but...
  
  The news came that the whole railway was finally blocked. Moreover, Haining city was fell to the highest level of the emergency-The city was sealed. New regulation proclaimed that all public transportations were banned. Schools and factories were haunted, and people were required to stay at home, unless for buying food. Yes, the whole city was sealed and blocked.
 
  So I couldn't come back to Haining. I was in Hangzhou then. What should I do?
  
  I was engulfed in horror and despair. I was racking my brains thinking about how to get into the city. Finally, I came to this.
  
  "Take the metro to Linpingnan Station, and ride back to Haining instead of taking the intercity railway train."
  
  I knew what it means to me-riding more than 40km and having to end my trip before midnight because if I arrive late, the blue passing code would be expired and I would not be able to enter the campus. But we have to try because we don't have any other methods, I thought.
  
  The night was dark and cold. Everything was restless but not me. I was standing in the carriage of the metro and holding my cellphone tightly, my heart pumping crazily. I didn't know whether I could pass the road check freely- if not, I would end up coming back to Hangzhou and being forced to segregate there for more than two weeks. At that moment, my heart was in a tangle, it seemed that I was the loneliest person in the world, although I was surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of unknown strangers. Finally, news on the WeChat board captured my eyes: "Students who are trapped in Zijingang, please don't be panic, we are contacting the school bus and trying to deliver you back. Please stay tuned for updated news."
  
  I typed to my instructor "I was locked in Hangzhou and I'm in Linpingnan railway station, what should I do?"
  
  " So firstly go back to Zijinggang Campus please."
  
  Other students who were also trapped in Zijingang Campus also said: "You should come back to Zijingang first. After all, it would be better to stay with other students."
  
  So I rushed back to Zijinggang.
  
  The night was cold and peaceful. When I finally made it to Zijingang Campus I was in relief. The bus was at nine o'clock, so I could firstly eat dinner. Walking in the familiar street feels great, and the night wind was cool. Lake Qizhen was like a mirror, reflecting lamp light from the road opposite. The wind dipped the lake surface and caused small ripples. The night sky was blue-dark and a few stars were shining there.
  
  So I walked up to the bus at last. The humming sound made me feel dizzy and wanted to sleep. The trip back seemed long, light outside began to diminish, and finally, darkness wallowed everything. Sounds began to fade away so everything turned quiet. Only went through obstacles could we taste the sweetness of well-being. I thought in a daze.
  And we arrived at the Haining campus. The night was the darkest since I came to the school. Quaranteen diminished light and pollution. The big dipper was dangling in the northern sky, shining amazingly.
