## New friends in my aquarium

My aquarium has been in a mess for a long time. It was full of algae since summer. The algae grew crazily and fulfilled the bottom and the wall of the aquarium, making the view unclear and ugly. However, as I tried to use all the methods to get rid of them, they still went flourishing in a few days.

So I went disappointed. Another reason why my aquarium went so messy is that I hadn’t got time to take care of it because I’m too busy in the first part of the semester, so I let it along. I noticed the condition of my aquarium can reflect my own mind to some degree-it shows that in this period of time my mind was also messy and unclear. So I need to do something, both to my aquarium and my mind.

Finally, I decided to introduce some shrimp to my aquarium. I also bought some waterweeds, including Tri-coloured lotus, Echinodorus Vesuvius, and Cryptocoryne wendtii. Since they are all tropical waterweeds, I’m not sure whether they can safely survive through the winter, but through good care and temperature control, I think they can.

Yesterday the shrimp arrive by express. In only a single day they’d eliminated nearly half of the algae, what a surprise! I believe the environment of the aquarium will go better.
