## 2022.4 20 Daily tour in Nanbie Lake!

 Fortunately, the covid case has been eliminated in Haining, and the quarantine has ended. We can freely go outside now!
  
  After this long period of quarantine, I was like an animal released from the cage, eager to touch the fresh air and the bright spring sunshine outside. So I decided to go to Nanbei Lake in Haiyan county. Because there were still traveling restrictions between Haining and Hangzhou, I could not wander to Hangzhou, so my destination could only be in Jiaxing. And for the daily trip, Nanbei Lake is a bit far away but not very far(about 20kms away from the campus), which is a suitable destination. 
 
 The weather is clear, although a little foggy. I got in a taxi and the trip began. It took about 40 minutes for me to get to my destination. As I saw the low mountains lying there, strong emotions start to flush into my mind. It reminds me of the old spring days when I was in Yueqing, spring was always the very time we can enjoy ourselves in the happiness of true nature-Bright sunshine, clear and blue sky, cold stream water, and red juicy berries in the forest. Although I was in middle school or high school, each month on the weekend I would like to visit mountains or nature sceneries. That feeling now became rushing into my mind. 
  
  In the bush near the road, wild roses were blossoming beautifully, and birds were singing happily. We were now in the countryside, and the sky was more clear the air fresher than in the urban areas. As I walked ahead, I noticed a road board written "HuiQuan Temple", with a sense of relief coming out of nowhere. I felt relaxed, seeing the skylineï¼Œ not in a line and so bored, lack of vitality, but now it has mountains blocking in the front, which was relaxing. Leaves of the trees had hearable sound in the mild wind, and the kingdom of spring was in here, In front of me.
  
  This time, I chose a small path to go into the mountain. I saw some dull sleepy birds and easily captureed them using my camera. As I went through the forest and came to a higher place, I found that there was a "window" where I could see the scenery in the distance more clearly. Now in front of me, I could see forests and trees below, with a different colors from light green to dark green. These colors formed different spots, which spread over the whole mountain. There was a little house lying at the foot of the mountain, being embraced by these spots of trees. Each element in the scenery intertwined with each other and was harmonious.
 
 Finally, I was able to climb to the hilltop, where I could see the whole lake and the Qiantang River. Unfortunately, there was a little fog so I could not see the Qiantang river so clearly, but that's enough. On the hilltop rock, there were Cherokee rose blossoming, with their flower much bigger than the wild rose. I was amazed by the scenery-flowers heading towards the sun, the lake, the river...

  After climbing down this small hill, I reached the lake. The wind was blowing so tides were rising from the lake. I followed the path I went on the last autumn, and revisited spots I'd been. Sitting in a pavilion beside the river, hearing the sound of the stream water, looking at the light that was being differentiated by layers and layers of leaves and reflected on the wall, hearing birds singing in the bush... I fetched a book to read. An old lady wearing blouse washed her hands in the pond, while I was eating chips and reading a book. 
  
  These mosquitos were so annoying! I couldn't get rid of them. They were always flying around me and trying to sting me and I felt itchy on my arm. I tried to run to get rid of these greedy mosquitos, but they ended up catching up with me again!
  
  At the noon I was walking on the mountain road, walking ahead leisurely. Another great pavilion lay beside the road and people were resting there. As I looked up, surprisingly two eagles were hovering in the sky. As I used my camera to look at them, I discovered they were not the same species-One with their wing white color, and flew very high; one was black in its wing and flew much lower than another one. Luckily I was able to shoot clear photos of them.  
  
  Another old lady was sitting in the bamboo deck chair near a temple. Two dogs were napping beside her. As I walked toward, the dogs got alerted. The old lady mildly called the dogs " sleep... sleep..." as if she was calling a baby to sleep.
  
  It was quiet. Two dogs and an old lady. Big trees. Wind. It was like summer. I was touched by the scenery in front of me.-- It's their life...
