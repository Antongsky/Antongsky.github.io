## Moon eclipse and Uranus eclipse 2022.11.8
  
The sky is so clear at the moment.
  
 “We are waiting for this astronomical feast.”
  
The moon eclipse will happen just after sunset and this is a full eclipse that will last for more than an hour.
  
Moreover, while in the full eclipse stage, Uranus will also be covered by the moon, making the event super rare.
 
 It’s an optimal opportunity to observe Uranus since the moon will not be bright anymore so the planet will not be diminished in the light of the moon.
 
 “I’m excited at the moment.”
 
 “Let’s gather after eating dinner.”
  
  We are waiting.
 
 After eating dinner, the day becomes darker, but I could not yet see the moon.
 
 Going out of my dorm, I see the moon dangling in the eastern sky. Waxed. 
 
 It is a broken moon since a corner of it is already lost.
 
 We emerge in happiness. 
 
 As the day becomes darker, the moon climbs up the roof. It stands on the top of the tower. It’s crescent.
 
 
 The last bit of the moon and the light are eaten by the darkness of night. We begin to see the red glow of the moon. 
  
  Like a diminished light bulb, with the color of charcoal that its light and heat are exhausted.
 
 Giant, glowing faint star.
 
 People say, it’s a blood moon.

 7:00 p.m.

“Hurry up we have to go to the roof of my dorm to see Uranus!”
 
 7:15 p.m. In the telescope I looked into the field of the eyepiece. On the lower left side of the field, there is a little star, just like other faint stellar.
 
 But it’s not. This is, Uranus.
  
  7:20 p.m. I see it moves behind the moon and disappeared.
 
 Leaving the telescope, I could still see the moon’s faint glowing big disc. 
  
  Until tens of minutes later.
  
  The edge of the moon becomes brighter and brighter.
 
 We are waiting.
  
  Brighter.
  
  Slowly a silver edge appears. This is the ending of the full eclipse stage.
 
 And we stay for another half an hour, to watch Uranus coming out.
