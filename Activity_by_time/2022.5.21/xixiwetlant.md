## The beginning of summer- a tour in Hangzhou

“5.21, summer started. The bright sun shone behind clouds, and the temperature rose under the bright sunshine. On the first day of summer, I decided to go on a trip to Hangzhou, where I would participate in an activity organized by ZJUCP, and on the next day I would go to Xixi wetland park with teacher Liang and students in Lvzhiyuan organization, to engage in a bird investigation program.”

ZJUCP had an activity on May 21. Not until I stepped out of the metro station did I notice the activity. 

"Whether to participate or not? " I wondered, thinking that if I do not attend, there would be a bunch of time in the afternoon that I can focus on photographing birds in the Zijinggang campus.  

But I also wanted to participate in activities. It's a good opportunity to play with fellow students in ZJUCP, and maybe I can meet new friends too! 

So finally, I decided to engage. 

Actually, this time the activity was held at xiaoyoulin, under the big ginkgo tree. That tree is the holly tree and is also special for our club.  We gathered at 3 pm when the sun began to tilt to the west. 

Everyone had great fun, doing childish activities, and said "this is about right for university students! "

Here, we were back in primary school, observing ant holes, collecting sticks, and playing simple games.

Sharing snacks was another great fun! We had watermelons, Coca-Cola, potato chips, and other snacks.  Afterward, we also received postcards sent by club departments' presidents. I was moved.

In the early night, the "Star shining light" was lit up in the twilight. It was surprising to see the light because it was only turned up for special days, a few times a year.  Yes, today's Zhejiang university's 125th anniversary! 

There were students walking and wondering on the bridge. They were also amazed by the light, so some of them stopped to look at the light.  I was sitting on the lawn behind the bridge. The light cast their shadow and a silhouette formed. The light behind them was really like a gigantic star, shining brightly. 

This is the beginning of the summer.

At night because I didn't want to spend money on a hotel, so I tried to stay in the club's glass room for the night.  I failed to fall asleep because the whole night I was fighting with mosquitoes. As I killed a group of them, a new group came... So, I didn't fall asleep and got up at 4:30a. m.  when the sky began to light up. 

The next day was thrilling!  We had been waiting for months and now the bird investigation activities finally come! Originally our teacher said that the first activity would be in March, but sadly covid-19 outbreak stopped our plan.  Now, with the situation becoming better, we were finally permitted to launch the activity. 
  
The morning in Xixi wetland was quiet and harmonious, with some people doing morning exercise. In the tree near the ponds, there were birds singing. We started our investigation at 7:20a. m.

We walked deeper into the Xialongtan reserve area, where we started to investigate birds. We heard the mixture of the sounds of birds, trying to distinguish uncommon species. I was amazed by how many birds species teacher Liang could distinguish. Rather than photograph what we saw, recording bird sound is also a good way to identify bird species!

We stayed in the area for 2 hours, then we walked out and had breakfast in Starbarks.  That’s the end of the trip.
