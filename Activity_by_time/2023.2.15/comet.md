## 2023.2.15 Observing the comet ZTF with guys in the astronomy club!
I was always interested in comets. Not only because they are rare, but they are also faint to be seen by the naked eye. Comets are also beautiful objects- they have charming tails and are like mops. Pitifully, I missed the neowise comet in the year 2020-the weather at that period of time when the comet was passing the earth was always cloudy, so I did not even get a chance. That neowise was very bright, that one could easily see it with the naked eye.
 
 This time, the comet is ZTF. The comet is not very bright, and the maximum magnitude at the peak when the comet reached the perigee is around 5. Unfortunately, I was on winter vacation so staying at home at that time. The sky condition in my hometown is really hard to be appreciated- even if the sky is clear, the light can light up the dark sky. Plus, it was almost rainy or cloudy around the winter holiday (when the comet reached perigee), so I hardly got the chance to even take out my binocular.
 
 I waited and waited. Until this week. The sky condition in Haining is good, at least better than that in my hometown. The cold front just passed, so the weather becomes breezing and cold, and most importantly, clear. I was thinking about: how about having a comet observation？ Although the ZTF comet has already flown further, but the magnitude is still around 6.5, which is visible using a telescope.
  
  We gathered at the east-north corner of the campus, at around 8:30 p.m. Firstly I used my bird-watching scope to find ZTF, which lies in the constellation of Tau. However hard I was trying to find out, the comet never appears in the field. I noticed a few faint stars whose magnitudes are around 7. That is bizarre, I thought. So, maybe it’s because the comet has a bigger area than the stars, which is almost like a dot. When sharing the same magnitude, basically, the object having a bigger area tends to appear fainter. That’s why the magnitude of Andromeda is below 5 but can be hardly seen by the naked eye.

  Our astronomy club has a big reflector telescope and is equipped with a star auto-finding system. They tried to type in the right ascension and declination of the comet, letting the system find the comet automatically. When trying to watch the comet using the telescope, I saw a very faint star-like object laying in the middle. It’s too faint to be hardly seen! But we have the camera. Using a long time of exposure, finally we made it! A faint dot with a vague tail appeared on the screen.
  
  “This is the first time I saw a comet!”
  
  “Yeah, me too! My first time.”
  
  We were drowned in happiness. Although the temperature was cold, dropping to 0 degrees, we are warm inside.
  
  “Why whenever we had a big discovery or observation, like this time and the last time watching the meteor shower, the temperature was always 0 degrees?” I asked. This is amazing.
