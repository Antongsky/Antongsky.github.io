## Stargazing on 7th and 9th April

  As the lockdown policy continues, a sharp decrease in cars and factory production leads to a fresher air and low light pollution.
 
  It has been so clear since 8th April that I decided to watch stars at night.
  
  Spring night sky has already appeared differently as it was in winter. The Orion constellation moves westward and falls in the early night, as well as Sirius.
  
  We took up our telescope at 11 o'clock and began to watch the stars.
 
  The big dipper hung highly in the northern sky. Except for UMa, we were able to see UMi, the little bear, which appeared fainter but could be distinguished by the naked eye.
  
  When we look at the southern sky, Leo was lying there. There are a bunch of galaxies between ε Vir and β Leo, and we tried to observe them using our telescope. Sadly they are too faint to be watched clearly, and we could only see the core of these galaxies appearing like faint stars. Subtlely, when looking very carefully, there seemed to be something like dust surrounding these cores. They are, I think, disks and arms of their galaxies.
  
  Looking westward, Vega hung low in the sky and shone brightly. In the binocular field, I could distinguish the shape of the constellation Lyr, like an instrument. δ1 and δ2 Lyrs are binary stars. They are separated distantly so can be distinguished in binoculars.

  I was wondering yesterday, thinking about whether I could see the milky way in the early morning. Because of the lockdown, the night sky must appear darker, so it's possible for Milkyway to appear, in this light-polluted city.
  
  So I set the alarm to 3:55 today and got up before dawn. 
  
  The weather was still clear, with some wind. Everything was still sleeping and the stars were shining brightly. I walked up to the roof and turned off the roof light. It was quiet and a bit terrifying, for everything was too quiet.
  
  Watching towards the southern sky, I could see a myriad of stars, but no Milkyway. Maybe, it was not high in the sky so there are still lamp lights that could diminish it, I thought. Taking out my camera, I tried to capture the brilliant sky. Finally, it appeared to be a faint light band in my photo-This was the milky way!
  
  Wallowed in peace, I waited for sunrise. The eastern sky keeps its darkness, then it became dark blue. Suddenly in a minute or two, there were glows appearing in the lower eastern sky, infiltrating from the horizon to the higher sky. The sky became lighter and lighter, and finally, it was bright. 
  
  Morning came, with a huge egg-like sun jumping up the horizon. Everything began to warm up. When looking back, windows of some distant high buildings had been dyed golden by the sunlight.
