## ECO activities at the end of March

  Spring is the best time to do things such as composting and working in the field. ECO club has launched a bunch of activities at the end of March. 
  
  Participating in these activities gives us a chance to embrace the warm sunshine and hug our mother nature. We feel by touching plant leaves, smelling the odor of the soil, watching birds flying here to there, and looking rape flowers blossoming which formed a bright-yellow river.
  
  This is the season that you can not lock yourself in the dorm-everything is restless and palpitate with excitement. 
  
  At the end of the spring, except for the daily compost activity, we tried to make a fence as well. And here's my personal project-Using the discarded blocks on the campus to build a flowerbed and plant flowers.
  
  For the fence, we collected bamboo sticks weeks before. Now we plug the thicker bamboo stick into the ground, act like posts. Thinner bamboo sticks are used to extend and stretch back and forth through these posts. We worked half of an afternoon on Sunday 27th March and were pleased to see our fence being half-builded.
  
  Actually, I didn't know how to build a fence before because I didn't need to build a fence. Through this time's practice, I've been equipped with the ability to build a fence.

  As for my personal project, I worked with LIn, Zhiyuan on Thursday. Because of the quarantine, the P.E. teacher from the Zijingang campus couldn't come to Haining, so we kept working on the flower bed during P.E. class time that afternoon.
  
  It's a hard thing to dig soil from a far place and put them back and pour them into the flower bed. Occasionally we also have to put compost soil in and mix them up. The compost soil is actually a very good fertilizer but you have to dilute it or mix it with soil, otherwise, the high concentration of nutrients would burn the plant. We also discovered a lot of earthworms in the compost. They were very lovely and lively.

   I could recall when we were doing the compost, I said:" This soil is heaven for bacteria!"
   
  Bacteria and worms act as degenerators and degenerate big molecules into small nutrient molecules which can be absorbed by plants. When they are working, the compost becomes very hot inside. That's why when we spread the compost there is a hot wave with white steam coming out.
  
   Spring is really a good season to be with nature. Feild working is like a factory, producing happiness incessantly.
