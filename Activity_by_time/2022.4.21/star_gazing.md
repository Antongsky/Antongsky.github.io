Trying new methods to shoot stars
  I was sitting on my sit, thinking if there are some methods I could better photograph the stars. 
  Originally I tried to press my phone camera onto the eyepiece but often failed because stars are too faint to be sensed by the camera. 
  Unless we try the moon-The moon can have a better look on our phone.
 
  An idea popped into my brain. Why not use a microscope electronic eyepiece to take photographs? Yes! Because the mechanism of microscope and telescope are similar if we can use an electronic eyepiece in the microscope, why can't we use it on the telescope?
  
  So at night, I called Chen, Shengzhi, and we went upstairs to the roof. It was 8 o'clock. After we assembled the telescope, we tried to point the telescope at a building at a distance. We located the electronic eyepiece in the place where the telescope eyepiece should be located and tried to adjust the zoom. As the light band on the building appeared on my computer, we were excited, because it proved the electronic eyepiece can be used in a telescope.
  
  Now, it turned to the real test! The first target was Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. When locating the eyepiece into the hole, its position was not upright, so we had to refind the object. Anyway, the wind was so heavy, that the whole lens was shivering and waving, letting the image shiver severely. After adjusting for several minutes, finally we made it! A distinct image was captured by the eyepiece, and I saved it to my computer. But what about the dimmer star? We were a bit worried, because after all, what we actually want to shoot was these dim stars and objects.
  
  ζUMa, a bright binary star in the constellation Ursa Major, became our target. On my computer screen, we could see the separation is too big that sometimes the stars moved out of the field. By keeping the two stars laying in the longitude of the screen, finally, we successfully enabled both of the stars to enter the field. But the wind was too heavy. We waited, waited, and waited. Caught the very short break that the wind diminished, we successfully shot the star.
  
  When we checked the photo, we were surprised to find another star-like bright dot near the star. Is it caused by accident, maybe the light reflection of the glass? When we checked the star atlas, we discovered it is a binary! Lately, we learned that ζUMa and 79UMa is an optical binary, and the two stellar themselves are binaries. So two binary stars form an optical binary. The close star we observed was actually the visual binary of ζUMa！
  
  Later on, we also observed αUMa, which is a visual binary. Because the separation is too small, we could only see two stars stick to each other. By manipulating the photo later with photoshop, I was able to make them more clear.
