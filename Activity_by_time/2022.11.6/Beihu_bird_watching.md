## 2022.11.6 Beihu bird-watching competition
  
  Both on 30 Oct. and 6 Nov. we went to Beihu, Hangzhou, to participate in the first Beihu bird-watching competition training and the official competition. In the training, only me and Zhao, Bingkang attended but in the official competition. I, Sun Yuhao, Zhao Bingkang, and Wei Bowen all participated as a group named “the Magpie-searching team”.

  Actually, it was great fun and precious experience in Beihu. Beihu wetland is a big grass marsh, a natural water reservoir from a long time ago and it’s close to the Liangzhu ruin, where our ancestors lived. 
  
  On the training day, we followed some experienced birders so finally we saw lots of rare birds. The way they search for the bird is also meaningful to us- we can learn a lot by just following them. For example, on our arrival, we saw a person who is also present in the Jiulong Mountain’s prey observation. Since we said “Hello” to each other, they are no way that we couldn’t follow him and co-observe the birds.
  
  There were numerous Buntings in the grass bellow the road, as well as the Common Stonechat. Surprisingly I found Emberiza aureola which is a very rare CR species. On our way back we met with Shuishan, who is observing ducks and geese flying in the sky. Not until that time did I notice that when flying, geese so much look like ducks, that’s why I couldn’t distinguish geese and missed lots of opportunities to photograph them.
  
  The day we participated in the official bird-watching competition was more challenging- we must find any birds by ourselves, not by any other people. The truth is that we were not so familiar with Beihu since I had just come once and two of our teammates hadn’t come to Beihu. We spent lots of time wandering in a place where there were no so many birds and when we finally walked to Xiamuqiao, where the bird diversity is larger, time is already late, so there were fewer birds coming out.

  However, whatever we met, again I met different kinds of new birds that I hadn’t seen before, and the competition itself is meaningful- it shows I’m not alone- there are so many bird lovers and we have the same interest. Also, the time spent with my teammates was happy and fruitful. Our total observed bird species was around 40 in the morning, which is not so good because lots of teams observed 60 or 70, but that doesn’t matter. I remember what Ms. Ou said: “Competition comes second…, bird observation comes first.” The competition reminds us that we have a big space to improve ourselves, both in the accuracy of identifying birds and in the efficiency to search for birds.
