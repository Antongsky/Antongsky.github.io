## 2022.3.23 ICPIP bird watching teams first observation!
  ICPIP program is a plant investigation program that aims to find out all the plant species in the international campus, ZJU. 
  As we cooperate with professor Liang's Campus Creature Capturing Program, we've organized a new group-bird watching group.
  
  It has been raining for days and the weather was cold and wet. 
  However, the sky clears up today! Spring is coming back, with the sunshine fulfills every corner of our campus. 
  Temperature also rises and flowers are blossoming drastically on the lawn, in the schoolyard, and almost everywhere. 
  I was so excited because of the good weather today, and I thought it was a good chance to organize our first bird-watching tour today.
  
  Actually, I was a bit nervous when I was waiting in the lobby in RC.2 because I really didn't know how many people would come. 
  The last time when I organise an activity, there were so few people who came that I felt really embarrassed. 
  "They're too lazy, not wanting to come out from the dorm and their only happiness is to playing computer games all day long that they wallow in it."  I thought.
  
  Surprisingly, there are lots of people came. A few students couldn't come because they had class this afternoon, that's reasonable. We gathered at 4 p.m. 
  Two of the students are photographers, and they're keen on taking beautiful photos.
  As they took out the artillery-liked camera,  knew it was going to be a great deal.

  We stepped out of the RC. lobby and went out to the lawn. Here at the top of the tree, we saw two Chinese Bulbul. 
  They must be a couple because they flew together. There is a skein of white hair on the top of these birds, so they are called "white-hair old man".

  As we walked further, we saw many other birds. For example, long-tailed magpie and Chinese spotted neck dove.
  Magpies were juping and finding food on the lawn, sometimes they jumped to the tree branch or flew to the top of the roof. But their sound was offensive.
  Chinese spotted neck doves have spotted dots on their neck, which makes it very easy for us to identify.

  There are water birds in the river at the south of our campus. Little grebes were swimming drowsily and separately. 
  If they discover there are people nearby, they will either dive into the water or fly away. Eurasian Teals are bigger water birds than little grebes. 
  They coupled in pairs and swam in the river leisurely. Sometimes some of them just stood in the islet and rested. It was fun watching these birds. 
  They have their own lives, which we have never noticed. They live in their own community and own world, which is as interesting and complex as human society.
