## 2022.5.10 E.coli transinfection outcome come out! 
Successfully cultivated. We transinfected a fluorecense gene plasmid into E. Coli and got some E. Coli that can show fluorescene under UV light.

1 Sample1: LB -PGLO    

2 sample2: LB -PGLO AMP

3 sample3: LB PGLO AMP

4 sample4: LB PGLO AMP ARA

PGLO: The plasmid. AMP: a antibiotic. ARA: A substance that can facilitate the expression of the fluorescene gene.

Outcome: 1 Lots of bacteria. Too much to seperate into dots. 2 No bacteria. Because AMP was added and bacteria were not transinfected. 3 A few bacteria dots. Only bacteria that were transinfected could survive (PGLO had also inserted anti-AMP gene). 4 A few bacteria dots that can show fluorescene.
