## 2022.11.22 Reflect

Actually, it has been a long time since I did not write this network diary. From the beginning of October to now, I have always been busy, being engulfed in schoolwork, club affairs, and my personal stuff. 

I did not calm down and have a look at the world around me. 	Every day I got up and begin the day in the dormitory. The first thing I do should always be to open the Japanese book and read the textbook, or finishing a deadline homework, or revise something. To me, morning hasn’t begun, until I eat breakfast and come back or until I go to the classroom and start the day’s class.

The ending of a day is also not so satisfying. Usually, I will stay up until past 12 o’clock and then go to bed. The reason why I stay up too late might be owing to the other students. It’s like we formed a microenvironment in our dormitory space, and anyone who lives in it will be affected by this microenvironment. Interesting?

But that’s not interesting to me. I always want to sleep earlier but I cannot. Some of the reason is owing to myself. Sometimes, after a day’s work, I will permit myself to have a relax. Usually read manga or watch Japanese anime. Usually I was addicted to it. One episode and another, until so late and I noticed the time then scratchy brushed my teeth, washed my face, and went to bed. 

This round goes on and on.

Finally, I noticed that although I am busy, I wasted lots of time. I wasted time so I don’t have time to fully give myself a relax, nor do I have time to do truly meaningful things.

So how to escape this dilemma? There’s yet no answer echoing in my mind. But I will keep searching for the answer.
