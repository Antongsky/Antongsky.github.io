## 2022.9.14 Experiencing typhoon "Plum"
 
It's nearly midnight. The typhoon is coming toward shanghai. The cyclone made its landfall at 8:30 in Zhoushan and continued to head toward towards northwest.
In the afternoon, there was no wind at all, only light rain fell from time to time. After dinner, the wind went heavier, and trees were all shaking and shivering.
After taking a bath, I decided to sit in my dorm, turn off all the lights and enjoy the pureness of the sound of the wind and the rain, while doing meditation. So quiet inside but outside is storming...
Not for a long time did I calm down like now-At the beginning of this semester, everything was in a hurry and it seemed that I don;t have as much time as in the last semester.
Sit down, be emerged in pureness, and embrace well-being.
