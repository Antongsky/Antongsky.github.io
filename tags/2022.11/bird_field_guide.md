## 2022.11 Bird field of the Haining campus comes out!

  As I said this is a teamwork of the ECO club, but actually lots of people do not think this is a really important thing, though, I have tried to let more people find happiness in nature observation.
  
  They don’t think it’s funny or meaningful. So, there were not many people participating in the club’s activity. However, I’ve tried my best.
  
  Through co-observation and investigation, the database of Haining’s bird species was set up and the bird field guide of the Haining campus has finally come out!
 
  I think this is meaningful. It would be better if we do some propaganda.
